# Project Happy Thoughts API

The assignment was to create my own API to a twitter-like app that i already made the frontend part to.

To make the API i used Mongo, mongoose and express.

## The problem

I approached the problem very methodological and thought out a plan for what to do in what order. Then I crossed one item off the list in the pre decided order. If i had more time i would love to make a username input for the frontend to store in the model as well so the users have the posibility to show who the message is from.
